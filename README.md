# demo_object_counting

This project aims to demonstrate a basic application that counts specific (cell phone, cup, bottle) objects through a WebCam.

**Attention:** If you are using Linux, the program will try to detect the first webcam connected (v4l-utils is a dependence), if you use Windows, the system will assume that the webcam has index 0.

**Warning:** This project is for purpose of demonstration and has some bugs that will be fixed in the future. For instance, when an object move fast, maybe it is counted two times.
